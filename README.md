## How to Check the Printer Status in Windows?

Normally when you print a document it spools to the printer and prints. When your document doesn't print, you need to determine if the printer is working properly. To start, check your printer status, which shows if the printer is working properly. The Windows 8 Devices and Printers lists all the printers your computer can use. You can use it to show the status of the printer and then check the queue and troubleshoot it as needed.

1. Press **"Windows + X,"** and then select **"Control Panel"**.
2. Select **"View Devices and Printers"** to open the **"Devices and Printers"** list.
3. Right-click on your **_[printer status](https://github.com/pcs0lution/screen-recorder-for-pc/)_** to see a list of options. To view the print queue, select **"See what's printing"**. To check general printer status, select "Properties," and to figure out if something is wrong with the printer select **"Troubleshoot"**.


## How to Change the Printer Driver Name in a List?

A printer communicates with your computer operating system via a driver, a type of software that defines the device's parameters and acts as a translator between the printer and the PC. When you install a printer to Microsoft Windows, the OS reads the data stored in the driver file to configure the device. This file, which typically has an ".inf" filename extension, contains a default name for the printer that Windows assigns automatically. Administrators can edit the printer name to make it easier for employees to identify.

1. Click **"Start"** and select **"Control Panel."** Click **"View Devices and Printers"** from under Hardware and Sound.
2. Scroll to **"Printers and Faxes"** and then right-click on the target **printer status** from the list. Select **"Printer Properties"** from the context menu.
3. Enter a new name for the printer on the General tab. Click **"OK,"** and then click **"Yes,"** if prompted.

## How to Reboot in Safe Mode?

Previous versions of Windows enabled quick access to Safe Mode by pressing "F8" during startup, but Windows 8 buried this option beneath a long series of unintuitive choices. Microsoft implies this decision was necessitated by Windows 8's quick start-up time that doesn't offer a large enough window to press the required key combination. To reboot in Safe Mode, you now need to instruct Windows to launch the Startup Settings before you restart your computer

1. Press **"Win-I"** to view the Settings Charm. Alternatively, move your mouse to the top right corner of the screen and click **"Settings"** from the Charm bar.
2. Click **"Change PC Settings,"** **"General"** and then **"Restart Now"** under the Advanced Startup section. Wait a few seconds for Windows 8 to prepare your computer.
3. Click **"Troubleshoot | Advanced Options | Startup Settings | Restart"** and wait several seconds for your computer to restart and load the boot menu.
4. Press "4" to reboot the computer in Safe Mode. Alternatively, press **"5"** to choose the Internet-capable **"Enable Safe Mode With Networking"** option or press **"6"** to choose the text-only **"Enable Safe Mode With Command Prompt"** option.
5. Log in to Windows 8 using an administrator account.
